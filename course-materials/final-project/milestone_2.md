# Final Project Milestone 2

Now that you've started generating some ideas and cleaned up some data, it's time to get to roll up the sleeves.

* Continue your work in the same notebook you've already created in Milestone 1

* Continue your data cleanup plan if your data is not yet cleaned up
   * This data cleanup code will eventually be transplanted into your final report notebook
   * Frequently click on "Run all cells" and make sure all your code continues to work as you expect!

* Now that the data is clean, start *analyzing* your data (Step 3 of the Data Science Workflow).
   * Make rough plots of the data to help with identifying interesting areas to focus on
   * The code/plots don't have to be perfectly clean right now, you'll eventually write a final notebook with cleaner code
   * Frequently click on "Run all cells" and make sure all your code continues to work as you expect!
   * Document, document, document!

* Now that you've done a bit of data exploration, you should be able to start refining the list of your possible problem statements from Milestone 1
   * Rewrite them if necessary, having uncovered some initial observations
   * Decide on the top 2-3 problems to start focusing on and thinking about

* Don't forget to **save** your notebook!
