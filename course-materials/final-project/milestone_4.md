# Final Project Milestone 4

You're now starting to wrap up your project and to Communicate your findings.

Communicate like your promotion depends on it!

![](../part-4/01-intro-to-ds/assets/ds_workflow.png)

* Continue your work in the notebook you've been working in

* Continue to wrap up anything you haven't finished from Milestones 1 to 3

* Continue to polish your report in your Final notebook
   * This will continue Step 4 and Step 5 of the Data Science Workflow: Interpret & Communicate
   * Continue writing explanations and justifications
   * Your job now is to tell a story from your findings
   * You should achieve a level of polish that you would be proud and happy to submit to your boss at work, for example
   * Be sure to frequently click on "Run all cells" and make sure all your code continues to work as you expect!

* Work on your 5 minute presentation
   * It is **required** to present your **Final** notebook
   * Do not present your *draft* notebook, it's only there for your rough work!
   * It is optional to have a slide deck in addition to the Notebook if you think it will help you communicate (this is rarely the case)

<!-- * [OPTIONAL] Sign the copy of the [GA Student Work Release](student_work_release.pdf) and slack it to your instructor, if you're OK with us showing off your work publicly to future students! You'll earn *beaucoup* karma points! -->
