# Final Project Milestone 3

You're deep in it now, keep going! We'll now start to transition from Step 3 of the Data Science Workflow to Step 4: Interpret.

![](../part-4/01-intro-to-ds/assets/ds_workflow.png)

* Continue your Analysis in your **DRAFT** notebook
   * Focus on the top 2-3 problems you identified in Milestone 2
   * Keep analyzing your data for interesting information
   * Start developing the final visualizations you will use
   * Continue to do any rough work in this notebook -- not everything in it will make it to the final report!
   * Your draft notebook is probably pretty messy by now! But it's done its job -- allowing you to explore the data and learn lessons from it. So now you should:

* Start your final report in a **NEW** notebook
   * Be sure to give it a proper name: "Pokemon Type and Power Analysis"
   * This will start Step 4 and Step 5 of the Data Science Workflow: Interpret & Communicate
   * This notebook will be your final project report. Make sure it is kept as clean as possible!
      * Imagine that this will the final report you will hand in to your boss

* Your focus now is to **tell a story** with your findings
   * Start transplanting code from your Draft notebook into this one. Not everything should or will make it into the final report
   * Transplant only the minimal amount of code from the draft notebook that you need to communicate your findings
      * Make sure every single line of code is useful
      * There should be no commented out blocks of useless code
   * Frequently click on "Run all cells" and make sure all your code continues to work as you expect!
   * Write justifications of your methodology in Markdown cells
   * Write explanations and interpretations in Markdown cells
   * You will finish this report in Milestone 4

* Don't forget to **save** your notebooks!

* Finally, on your final notebook, click <kbd>Share</kbd>, and change the notebook to **Public**
   * This gives you a URL that you can copy
   * Privately slack the instructor with the URL to your notebook
   * Do understand that all notebooks Shared Publicly on Kaggle is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) -- see [Apache License 2.0 in Plain English](https://tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2.0-(apache-2.0))
      * This is the nature of Kaggle, a community of data scientists, where everything is shared with everyone
   * This allows your final project to be part of your portfolio of work! And of course Kaggle is the proper place to display such a piece of work
   * Talk to your instructor if you don't want to make your notebook public for some reason

* If you've created your own Dataset instead of using an existing dataset, be sure to set that to **Public** as well
