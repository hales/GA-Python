# Python Programming: Final Project

We'd like you to have something tangible to show for having taken this course with us, so let's use your newly acquired data science skills to make a project with Jupyter Notebook and Pandas!

In order to receive a Certificate of Completion, you must successfully complete the final project according to the Deliverables and Requirements below.

You are free to complete a project about any topic you'd like, as long as it meets the requirements listed below.

You will work individually on this project, but feel free to share inspiration, resources, or cool data sets that you find with your classmates!

# Deliverables

The two core deliverables are:

1. A Pandas project, written in a Jupyter Notebook, on Kaggle
   <!-- * It is possible to do another type of project, e.g. a Game or something similar -- but you must seek approval from the instructor, before the official launch of Milestone 1
   * **Note:** Alternative projects will only be considered if you are already working in the software development field, or otherwise an advanced student -->
2. Present your final project notebook to your cohort for 5 minutes
   * It's not necessary to have slides, your notebook and visualizations should speak for itself!

## Requirements

Your assignment **must** include:

1. Data from at least one data set
   * Choose a data set from kaggle.com and start your notebook from there
   * You can also get creative by using another source of data
      * At the bottom of this page is a list of free datasets
      * If you choose this route, you'll have to manage bringing the data into Kaggle yourself
1. Cleaning the data
   * Handling of N/A, NULL, NaN, and empty or invalid values
   * Handling inconsistencies
   * Dealing with other potential errors in the data
1. Data displayed with a minimum of **two** different visualizations
   * Take care that they're the best choice of visualizations for the information you are trying to communicate and are easy to comprehend
1. Justification of your methodology written in Markdown cells, so another data scientist can easily understand your analysis
1. Comments in your code if necessary and as appropriate
1. Demonstration of your mastery of core Python concepts (_only if it makes sense to use in your project!_):
   * Data Types
   * Functions
   * Loops
   * Lists/Tuples/Dictionaries
   * File Input/Output (_*_)
   * Advanced arguments: kwargs/`*args`/`**kwargs` (_*_)
   * Error handling `try`-`except` blocks (_*_)
   * User input (_*_)
   * OOP `class`es (_*_)
   * (_*_) Some of the above are less applicable to Data Science projects but may be interesting if doing a different type of project

As the project is two weeks in duration, no grace periods apply. You are expected to start your project on time, work steadily towards completion, and meet expectations for the final project. Please communicate with us if any extenuating circumstances develop so that we can help you manage your time accordingly.

To qualify for a Letter of Completion, you must satisfactorily complete the final project and present it to your classmates.

# Project Milestones

Each forthcoming lesson, you will be expected to hit project milestones!

* [Milestone #1](milestone_1.md)
* [Milestone #2](milestone_2.md)
* [Milestone #3](milestone_3.md)
* [Milestone #4](milestone_4.md)

The milestones will be discussed each week.

However, these milestones are for your own benefit only! They are only for your use in making sure you're progressing at the proper pace. They are not "enforced" in any manner, and there is nothing to hand in. You are all adults and you are expected to manage your own time and progress on your final project.

Do not feel constrained by the milestones; you can speed ahead if you like. Conversely, if you don't do the minimum required by the milestone, you will likely fall behind.

# Tips

1. If you're having trouble coming up with a topic, consider:
   * What kind of data might be available about your hobbies?
   * Doing an analysis as a "gift" to a loved one, about some data *they* might be interested in
   * Doing something you think would improve your life in some way
1. If this is your first programming/data science class, find a data set that is contained within one `.csv` file, as this is the most common scenario that we'll cover in class!
   * If the data you are interested in is spread across multiple files, it'll be a bit more challenging and not recommended for beginners. Talk to the instructor, if that's the case

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning ahead, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
* **Read the docs** for whatever technologies or data sets you use. Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow! Learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something before implementing it is a big help

# Evaluation

Your project will be evaluated based on the rubric below.

| Score | Expectations |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Incomplete |
| 1 | Does not meet expectations |
| 2 | Meets expectations, good job! |
| 3 | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you! |

A zero-to-three grading scale may not intuitively make sense, so here is an example using the criteria as if your assignment were to cook a pizza:

| Criteria | **0** Incomplete | **1** Does not meet expectations | **2** Meets expectations | **3**  Exceeds expectations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crust | No crust present. Submission is just cheese and sauce on a plate. | Pizza has a crust, but it is raw | Crust is cooked thoroughly | Crust is golden brown and just thin enough without being too thick |
| Cheese | No cheese present | Cheese is made of soy | Cheese covers the pizza from edge to edge | Cheese is delicious, plentiful, and melted to perfection |
