# To the Notebook!

Let's proceed to the Jupyter Notebook for this lesson.

You can locate it inside your Kaggle account under <kbd>Code</kbd> :arrow_right: <kbd>Your Work</kbd> :arrow_right: <kbd>Shared With You</kbd>

You won't be able to make changes to that notebook (as it's the instructor's copy).

So, once you have it open, click the <kbd>Copy and Edit</kbd> button (upper right hand corner) to make a copy of the notebook, so that you can make changes to it!
